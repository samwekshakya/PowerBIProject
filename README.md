# PowerBIProject
A Beginner Project of PowerBi

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing data using Power BI, particularly through Power Query for data preparation and dashboard creation. It involves performing the following key tasks:

1. **Standardize the Data**: Applying Power Query techniques to standardize data formatting, ensuring consistency across columns (e.g., dates, text, numerical values) and adjusting data types as needed.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Dropping columns that are no longer needed for analysis within Power Query, which helps to streamline the data model and focus only on relevant information.

3. **Creation of New Columns**: Using Power Query's calculated columns to create new data based on existing columns, such as aggregating values, categorizing data, or transforming data for further analysis.

4. **Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation**: Importing the cleaned dataset into Power BI to create meaningful visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts that summarize the data effectively.

5. **Customizing the Dashboard**: Tailoring the layout, design, and interactivity of the Power BI dashboard to meet specific reporting needs, including adding slicers, filters, and drill-through features to enhance user experience and insights.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate essential data cleaning techniques, data preparation, and the creation of insightful visualizations and interactive dashboards using Power BI, ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis and reporting.
